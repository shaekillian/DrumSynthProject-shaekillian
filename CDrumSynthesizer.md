# This is a file describing the CDrumSynthesizer component of my project

The CDrumSynthesizer is responsible for generating individual drum sounds as WAV files. It provides functions to create various drum instruments including:
- Kick drum
- Snare drum
- Tom (low and high)
- Cymbal
Each instrument has a configurable duration and can be processed with envelopes to shape the amplitude over time.

Ownership: This component was developed by Shae Killian

Supported Grading Elements:
- Multiple percussion sounds
- Envelopes for attack and delay with envelope() function
- Variable parameters such as frequency, duration, and velocity
- No pre-recorded loops
- WAV export capability with CWavFileWriter

Here is a snippet of this component in use:
CDrumSynthesizer drum;
drum.GenerateKick("kick_drum.wav", 15.0);
drum.GenerateSnare("snare_drum.wav", 15.0);
drum.GenerateTom("tom_low.wav", 15.0, 100.0);
drum.GenerateTom("tom_high.wav", 15.0, 150.0);
drum.GenerateCymbal("cymbal.wav", 15.0);

This snippet is creating the 15-second demo clips of each aspect of my drum kit.
